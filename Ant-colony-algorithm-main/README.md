# Ant Colony algorithm

## Introduction

This is the python implementation of ant colony algorithm.
Dynamic graphs are used to show the dynamic change when running the algorithm

The code references [excellent Github code in python](https://github.com/ppoffice/ant-colony-tsp) about some function arguments and names and values, especailly thanks for his contribution, offers me great help.

## Use

- easy run as

  ```python
  python main.py
  ```

- use examples in `./data/example-x.txt` as\
  change x into number 1~6, using the given data

  ```python
  python main.py --test x
  ```

- change arguments of ant colont algorithm
  - `ant`: the number of ants
  - `points`: the number of points
  - `generation`:the number of iteration
  - `alpha`:relative importance of pheromone
  - `beta`:relative importance of heuristic information
  - `rho`:pheromone residual coefficient
  - `q`:pheromone intensity
  - `strategy`:pheromone update strategy. \
    see more details in code annotation
    - 0 - ant-cycle
    - 1 - ant-quality
    - 2 - ant-density
  - `min_x`,`max_x`,`min_y`,`max_y` the range of values of points(x,y)

  ```python
  python main.py --ant 20 --points 50 --rho 0.2 --max_x 1000 --max_y 1000
  ```

  **pay attention that changing the arguments may imporve the algorithm in some cases, or behave worse**

## Attention

  each run will create a record file `./temp.txt`, if you want to use the data again by different strategies,\
  you should move it to `./data/` and rename it as `./data/example-x.txt` and then use `--test x`.\
  The result will be saved as `./result.png` for each run.

  **If the final picture seems mad or has more than one line, that means it does not converge to a local optimal solution at the end of the iteration. So you need to change your arguments choice, such as increase `rho` or decrease `q` and so on**

  As the [blog](https://www.cnblogs.com/bokeyuancj/p/11798635.html) said, ant colony algorithm is barely useful in solving small-scale TSP problems, and the optimal solution can be found in a little time. However, if the problem scale is large, the performance of ant colony algorithm will be very low or even stuck. So it can be improved, such as elite ant system.

  **This code is just a simple realization of ant colony algorithm, when I run the code myself I also find some inappropriate simulation results and strange simulations.**

  If you find any bug or suggestions to improve, please leave your advice in issue.
